This application runs as a daemon on your download host. It checks for completed downloads and extracts them so Radarr, Lidarr, Sonarr, and Readarr may import them

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/unpackerr](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/unpackerr)
