This Chart will download and install the version of OpenTTD that you enter in the variable 'GAME_VERSION' (if you define 'latest' it will always pull the latest build, if you define 'testing' it will always pull down the latest testing build).

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/openttd](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/openttd)
