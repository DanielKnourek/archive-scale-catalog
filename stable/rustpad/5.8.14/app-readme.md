Rustpad is an efficient and minimal open-source collaborative text editor based on the operational transformation algorithm. It lets users collaborate in real time while writing code in their browser. Rustpad is completely self-hosted and fits in a tiny Chart, no database required.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/rustpad](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/rustpad)
