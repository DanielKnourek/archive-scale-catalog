HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat, but unlike XChat it’s completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems. Since XChat is open source, it’s perfectly legal. For more info. HexChat was originally called XChat-WDK which in turn was a successor of freakschat.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/hexchat](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/hexchat)
