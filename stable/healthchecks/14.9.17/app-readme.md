Healthchecks is a cron job monitoring service. It listens for HTTP requests and email messages ("pings") from your cron jobs and scheduled tasks ("checks"). When a ping does not arrive on time, Healthchecks sends out alerts.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/healthchecks](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/healthchecks)
