This application backs up every folder mounted at `/data/` to a given AWS S3 path using the `aws s3 sync` command. It requires a pair of (IAM) Access and Secret Keys.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/s3sync](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/s3sync)
