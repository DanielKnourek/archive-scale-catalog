h5ai is a modern file indexer for HTTP web servers with focus on your files. Directories are displayed in a appealing way and browsing them is enhanced by different views, a breadcrumb and a tree overview. Initially h5ai was an acronym for HTML5 Apache Index but now it supports other web servers too.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/h5ai](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/h5ai)
