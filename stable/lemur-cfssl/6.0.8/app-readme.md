Lemur manages TLS certificate creation. While not able to issue certificates itself, Lemur acts as a broker between CAs and environments providing a central portal for developers to issue TLS certificates with 'sane' defaults.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/lemur-cfssl](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/lemur-cfssl)
