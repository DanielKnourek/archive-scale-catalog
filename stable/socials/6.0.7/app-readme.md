Socials is a single-page website that stores all your social media and personal websites to share. It is similar to tappy.tech, sociallinks.co, and linktr.ee, but open-source and built using Typescript, Sass, Express.js and EJS. Self-hosting or publishing as a static website or Chart is recommended!

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/socials](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/socials)
