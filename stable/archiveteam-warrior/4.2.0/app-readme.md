The Archive Team Warrior is a virtual archiving appliance. You can run it to help with the Archive Team archiving efforts. It will download sites and upload them to our archive—and it’s really easy to do!

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/archiveteam-warrior](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/archiveteam-warrior)
