Semaphore is a modern, open source alternative to Ansible Tower. It is a self-hosted web-based solution that allows you to create and manage Ansible projects, playbooks, and roles, while also providing a web interface for running and monitoring Ansible tasks.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/semaphore](https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/semaphore)
